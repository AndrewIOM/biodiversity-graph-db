The papers concerned with nutritional aspects are dealt with by established nutrition experts and cover a wide field of topics.E.M. Widdowson (1-18, 48 ref.), looks at the nutrient needs from birth to old age and A.E. Bender (415-424, 11 ref.) asks if we are adequately fed, questioning the usefulness of recommended daily intakes as a measure for this.An interesting account of infant nutrition by D.E.M. Francis (469-485, 36 ref.) highlights yet again the advantages of breast feeding. Despite this, breast feeding in the UK has declined and the implications of this in terms of obesity and protein-energy malnutrition are discussed.The common supposition that obesity and anorexia nervosa are opposite poles of a spectrum of eating disorders is questioned by J.S. Garrow (459-468, 12 ref.). With the development of new analytical techniques, ideas about dietary fibre have crystallized, and J.H. Cummings (441-458, 41 ref.) takes a broad view of some aspects of dietary fibre metabolism. In contrast, the influence of specific nutrients and contaminants in food on brain development and mental function receives a more detailed account. Four papers are directly concerned with microbial contaminants in foodstuffs : Salmonella, Clostridia and mycotoxins are discussed in a detail which should be of value to readers with a general interest in those areas, but which adds little to present knowledge in those fields.The paper by D.A.A. Mossel (129-166, 349 ref.) on assessing health risks due to microbial contamination in foods is an enlightened treatment of the topic, which may stimulate action to reduce the incidence of food poisoning. He focusses on the need for ""measures ... (rather than) measurements"", but also helps to reduce the complexity of the literature on microbial quantitation. In this paper we are told of the possible benefits from radiation of raw foods and in a subsequent paper we read of the present status of irradiation programmes in commercial practice. The latter paper, by F.J. Ley (333-343, 5 ref.), is a concise statement of progress being made and we discover that whereas the UK has a general ban on sale of irradiated food for human consumption other countries such as the Netherlands, USSR and Canada have a 10- to 20-year history of acceptance of such products.This book bringing together so many aspects of health and nutrition should be useful to those in the field who were unable to attend what seems to have been a most interesting Symposium, and for the convenience of the reader each paper commences with an abstract.O.

It comprises sections on the history of tropical floras (2 papers); the general phytogeography of tropical floras (4 papers); regional phytogeography and investigation of tropical floras (11 papers); taxonomic and biological examples (13 papers, including a critical appraisal of the Solanaceae in the Neotropics). Concern was expressed at the rate of extinction of whole vegetations before their plants had been studied or recorded. The urgent need for field work on tropical floras was stressed.

Two years later, on the establishment of the Experimental Farms system, Dr. James Fletcher who occupied the position, was attached to the new Branch of the Department of Agriculture in the joint capacity of Entomologist and Botanist, which position he occupied with conspicuous success until his death in 1908. The growth in importance of the two subjects necessitated their separation and accordingly Divisions of Entomology and Botany were created. Dr. C.

Geobotanical sketch maps are presented showing: reconstructed vegetation cover in the late 17th century before agricultural development, containing 71% of 'small-leaved forest' (Betula/alba/Populus tremula) and 1.5% riparian willow groves; the actual present cover with 24.3% of forest (including most of the riparian stands) and large areas of secondary meadow and arable land; and predicted cover with optimum land use, involving redistribution of some forest and meadow areas and individual meadow types with each other and with arable land, without net change in the total forest area. The meadow vegetation is classified into 51 associations. Successions of meadow vegetation are described, originating from small-leaved forest, riparian forest or steppe forb meadows in 3 stages of increasing human disturbance. It is recommended that 30% of the forage lands should consist of quasi-natural meadows to preserve their gene pools.","Abramchuk, A. V.; Gorchakovskii, P.
